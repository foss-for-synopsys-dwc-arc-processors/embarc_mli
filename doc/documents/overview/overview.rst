Introduction
------------

The Machine Learning Inference Library is the basis for machine learning inference for 
ARC VPX, ARC EMxD, and ARC HS4xD families of ARC DSP cores. Its purpose is to 
enable porting of machine learning models mostly based on NN to ARC processors.

The MLI library is a collection of ML algorithms (primitives) which roughly can be 
separated into the following groups: 

  - :ref:`chap_conv`

  - :ref:`chap_rec_full`

  - :ref:`chap_pool`

  - :ref:`chap_diverse_kern`

  - :ref:`chap_transform`

  - :ref:`chap_element_wise`
  
  - :ref:`chap_utlity_func`
 
MLI supported primitives are intended for

   - ease of use
   
   - inferring efficient solutions for small/mid-sized models using very limited resources 

Purpose of This Document
------------------------

The document describes 
  
  - the usage of MLI primitives and 
  
  - the technical details of MLI primitives such as 
    
    - data formats 

    - data layouts

    - quantization schemes 

    - kernel naming convention

    - supported kernels 
   
Memory Hierarchy
----------------

The functions in the MLI API operate on the lowest level in the memory hierarchy: the local 
memories (for example: DCCM, VCCM, and so on). All the memory movement needs to happen at a level above the MLI API. 
The data move functions can be used for the purpose. Inside the MLI kernels, there is no data movement. 
The strategy on data movement can be different for each platform or each application. For some 
platforms and some applications, all the data could fit in CCM, in which case no data movement 
is needed. Some platforms have a data cache; in those cases the data movement is done by the 
hardware in a transparent way. The caller/user of MLI APIs is responsible for ensuring that all 
data buffers passed to the MLI functions are in the CPU's local memory prior to making the call.

The MLI library does not allocate any memory dynamically. The caller is responsible for providing 
the correct parameters and allocated memory. The MLI library might use internal statically allocated 
data.

Header Files
------------

To ensure consistency for users, the following public header files are provided with  
MLI Implementation.  These are intended to be included by the application code:
  
  - ``mli_types.h``: This file contains definitions of the various data structures defined elsewhere 
    in this document.
  
  - ``mli_config.h``: This file describes configuration-related parameters as well as platform-specific 
    data
  
  - ``mli_api.h``: This file (or sub-include files) declares the MLI API functions
